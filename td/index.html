The idea is to combine a tower defense style game with a generic algorithm for creating monsters.
This would be a rogue-lite thing where there would be some fun variation on each playthrough
maybe even upgrades might work along the same genetic lines. Instead of a fixed technology tree you would have researchers who iterate on the spell or behavior rather than unlocking a known next step
